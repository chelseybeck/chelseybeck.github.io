This is a Jekyll site hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). The [code repository is public](https://github.com/chelseybeck/chelseybeck.github.io), so it's free forever (or, presumably for the life of GitHub). I tried a few alternatives before landing on the Jekyll tech stack with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) theme. 

I wanted something simple, clean, and easy. [Cotes Chung](https://github.com/cotes2020) has built a solid Jekyll theme with great features that meet my needs. The getting started instructions are easy to follow and I had a site running locally pretty quickly. Using GitHub Pages to host the site was an easy choice. There is no cost as long as you keep the code repo public. :) 

The comments utilize GitHub discussions via the [giscuss app](https://giscus.app/).

[Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/) seemed like a solid choice as a platform as well...but it runs on Django...making it incompatible with GitHub pages. It's also more complex than what I needed and I'm super happy with this style and layout. If you're looking to build out a content management system with multiple contributing authors, Wagtail might be the way to go. Django is easy to install and setup, but you do need to find a place to host it.
