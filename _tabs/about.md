## Me
Hi, I'm Chelsey. I am deeply interested in all things dataâ€”with an emphasis on modernizing data workflows. I'm a Staff Data Engineer working @ Mozilla, helping to build data pipelines and infrastructure that supports analytics and machine learning.

## How I got here
My journey with data began years ago (not saying how many) working as an intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army. Querying intelligence data was pretty badass, but my most valuable experience was working with a (relatively) small Microsoft Access database. Security clearances were backlogged during my first assignment, and I was tasked with maintaining a relational database to track incoming and outgoing Soldiers for our unit. It was love at first sight and exposed me to a new world of task efficiency and data-driven decision-making. 

## What I do
These days, I mostly build data infrastructure in the cloud and orchestrate workflows for ETL processes. I've dabbled in other things along the way (graphic design, web development, writing, and nonprofit leadership); but for me, nothing compares to moving and transforming data to empower discovery. 

## What to expect here
I love to learn, and this space primarily serves as a way to share knowledge. Expect some tech industry blogging and perhaps a few tutorials.

## Volunteering
In my spare time, I volunteer with [Hack for L.A.](https://hackforla.org), a civic tech organization that has been an invaluable resource for me over the years. If you're interested in learning new technologies or leadership and mentoring opportunities, check them out. 

## Fun stuff
I enjoy hiking in the hills of Southern California, gaming (most recently, [Diablo IV](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/)), martial arts ([Hapkido](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRMbAQq2yxs)), and climbing (indoors so far).
